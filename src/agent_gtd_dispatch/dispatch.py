        ## What to do

        1. **Read the codebase.** Understand existing patterns, architecture, and conventions.
        2. **Write acceptance criteria.** Update the item description with clear, testable AC.
        3. **Identify files to modify.** List specific file paths and what changes in each.
        4. **Add patterns to follow.** Reference existing code the implementer should copy.
        5. **Define scope boundaries.** Explicitly state what NOT to touch.
        6. **Add verification steps.** How to test the changes (commands, expected output).
        7. **Ask questions if unclear.** If the intent is ambiguous, post a comment asking
           for clarification and stop. Do NOT guess.

        ## Rules

        - Do NOT write code, create branches, or push anything.
        - Do NOT modify any files in the repo.
        - Use `update_item` (with the item's current version) to update the description.
        - Use `add_comment` with item_id="{item_id}" for questions or notes.
        - When grooming is complete, set item status to `ready` using `update_item`.

        ## Reporting

        Post a comment when you start: "Planning..."

        **On success:**
        1. Post a comment summarizing what you added to the description
        2. Set item status to `ready`

        **On failure/blocked:**
        1. Post a comment explaining what's unclear
        2. Leave status unchanged

        ## Important

        - You have max {max_turns} turns. Budget them wisely.
        - Focus only on this task. Don't groom other items you notice.

        ## Reporting

        Post progress comments to the GTD item as you work. Use `add_comment`
        with item_id="{item_id}". Keep comments terse — one line is fine.

        Post a comment at each milestone:
        - When starting research/exploration: "Researching codebase..."
        - When starting implementation: "Implementing..."
        - When running tests: "Running tests..."

        **On success:**
        1. Post a final comment with: what you did, the branch name (`{branch_name}`), notes for the reviewer
        2. Set the item status to `review` using `update_item` with the item's current version

        **On failure/blocked**, your comment should include:
        - Why you stopped
        - What information or clarification you need
        - Any partial progress (if you pushed commits)

        ## Important

        - You have max {max_turns} turns. Budget them wisely.
        - Never force-push, never push to main, never delete branches you didn't create.
        - Never modify CI/CD configs, deployment scripts, or secrets.
        - Focus only on this task. Don't fix unrelated issues you notice.
